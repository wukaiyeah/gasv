GASV and GASVPro Release February 26, 2014 =================

* Corrected a memory issue in BAMToGASV.jar which improves
the memory usage.

* Modified the usage information for GASV.jar so that users
with a *gasv.in file are guided to the the "--batch" option
for GASV.

* Corrected an error in processing alternative chromosome
naming files in BAMToGASV_AMBIG.jar.

GASV and GASVPro Release October 1, 2013 =================

* Corrected a bug in GASVPro-HQ.sh and GASVPro.sh so that
the default behavior is to ignore translocations.

* Added support for Illumina Mate Pair orientation to 
BAM file processing.

GASV and GASVPro Release June 27, 2013 =================

GASVPro (Version 1.2.1)

* Corrected a problem with GASVPro coverage model 
for reciprocal inversions (IR) and reciprocal translocations
(TR+ and TR-).

GASV and GASVPro Release October 12, 2012 =================

GASVPro (Version 1.2):

Modifications to GASVPro-HQ.sh and GASVPro.sh scripts:

* Added Translocation Flag scripts
Now users more clearly specify if translocations should
be analyzed.

* Updated GASVPro.sh script to clean-up temporary files
created as default behavior.

* Added OUTPUT format option, users can now specify the
same clusters formats as GASV (clusters, reads, intervals)
(As for GASV, intervals is the default.)

scripts/:

* Updated GASV Pruning code (GASVPruneClusters.pl) to 
also handle translocations

* Added convertClusters program, which carries out the final
conversion of GASVPro output to appropriate GASV formats.

GASV and GASVPro Release August 16, 2012  =================

* Updated documentation and work flow description of GASV
software.

GASVPro (Version 1.1):
* Corrected a problem with updating read depth counts.

GASV and GASVPro Release August 2, 2012  =================

GASVPro (Version 1.0):
* Sripts for simplified execution of standard GASVPro pipelines:
bin/GASVPro-HQ.sh
bin/GASVPro.sh

* Documentation detailing GASVPro options and parameters.

BAMToGASV (Version 2.0.1):
* GASVPro flag, automatically creates input parameters for GASVPro

BAMToGASV_Ambig (Version 1.0):
* BAM file preprocessor for "low-quality" mappings. That is, reads may have
more than one reported mapping.

RELEASE 2.0 ============================================

GASV:
* Simplified GASV usage and execution by defaulting to 
  clustering mode.
* Default clustering now reports variants with at least
  4 supporting mappings. Using "--minClusterSize 1"
  option when running GASV.jar will revert to previous
  behavior.
* Changed GASV translocation reporting.
* Revised/expanded GASV documentation.
* Throughout the term ESP (end-sequenced pair) has 
  been replaced by PR (paired-read) 
* Although still functional, we have deprecated the 
  following modes: --nocluster, --filter 

BAMToGASV:
* Replaced BAM Preprocessor by "BAMToGASV.jar"
* More robust handling of BAM files.
* If paired reads are not detected in a BAM file, a 
Fixmate() function is called automatically and a new 
BAM file is written.
* Coordinates in Paired-Read files are now reported as 
alignment start and alignment end, rather than alignment 
start and (alignment end + 1)
* Lmin must be non-negative and smaller than Lmax, but 
it is allowed to be smaller than 2*(read length).
* New beta options are available, including writing 
low-quality pairs and concordant pairs 

NEW IN RELEASE 1.5.2 ===================================

*Corrected typo in BAM Preprocessor & Updated Documentation.

NEW IN RELEASE 1.5.1 ===================================

*Corrected typo in BAM Preprocessor & Updated Documentation.

NEW IN RELEASE 1.5 =====================================

* Added support for SOLiD sequencing format.
* Added command-line specification of Lmin/Lmax for
   individual libraries.
(See BAM_preprocessor.txt for more information.)
* Corrected bug in BAM_preprocessor.pl

NEW IN RELEASE 1.4.1 ====================================
* Added the --noreciprocal option.

NEW IN RELEASE 1.4 ====================================

* Simplified BAM_preprocessor.pl execution. 

  - USAGE:
	% perl BAM_preprocessor.pl <bam file or hyperlink of bam file>

* Added support for remote BAM files (http:// or ftp://) 
  (See BAM_preprocessor.txt for more information.)

* Added additional error checking to BAM Preprocessor:

- Checks for read pairing information in BAM file.
  To fix BAM file, run samtools fixmate command.

- Checks if four types of structural variants (inversion, divergent, deletion,
  translocation). 
  If an SV type is not found, a warning is printed but the program continues.

* Added support for alternate chromosome naming
  (See BAM_preprocessor.txt for more information.)

* Added maximum length of mapped ends "-PROPER_LENGTH <proper_length>" to
  BAM_preprocessor.pl in computation of standard deviation to avoid biasing
  Lmin/Lmax by extreme outliers.
  (See BAM_preprocessor.txt for more information.)

* Fixed two critical translocation bugs, one of which arises when references
  in the BAM files are described as chr3, chr4, etc. rather than just plain 3, 4
  etc. The other arises when X and Y are used rather than 23 and 24.

* Changed the GASV clusters type output for translocations:

- Reciprocal translocations "TR" have two distinct types
  "TR" to represent classic reciprocal translocations (+- and -+) 
  "TO" to represent Robertsonian-type translocations (++ and --)

- Non-reciprocal translocations "T" type have four distinct types: 
  "TNR+" to represent (+-) classic non-reciprocal translocations
  "TNR-" to represent (-+) classic non-reciprocal translocations 
  "TNO+" to represent (++) Robertsonian-type translocations 
  "TNO-" to represent (--) Robertsonian-type translocations

NEW IN RELEASE 1.3.1 ====================================
* Fixed BAM_preprocessor.pl bugs which arise when running multiple instances of the BAM_preprocessor.pl concurrently and within the same directory.

* Now the *.discordant file originally output by BAM_preprocessor.pl is automatically removed to conserve disk space

NEW IN RELEASE 1.3 ====================================
* New --cluster and --nocluster output modes as determined by 
the --output [mode] option:

[mode] = standard  (which is the default)
Cluster_ID:	LeftChr:	LeftBreakPoint:	RightChr:	RightBreakPoint:	Num PES:	Localization:	Type:

[mode] = reads  
Cluster_ID:	LeftChr:	LeftBreakPoint:	RightChr:	RightBreakPoint:	Num PES:	Localization:	Type:	List of PES:

[mode] = regions
Cluster_ID:	Num PES:	Localization:	Type:	List of PES:	 LeftChr:	RightChr:	Boundary Points:

Note that the "--output regions" mode closely matches the output from 
release 1.2, except for the new "Type:" field, which is common to all 
three output modes. This new Type field indicates the type of 
variant predicted by the cluster, according to the following key:
D = Deletion
IR =  Reciprocal Inversion (both ++ and --)
I+ = Inverted Orientation (++ side only)
I- = Inverted Orientation (-- side only)
T = Translocation
TR = Reciprocal Translocation
V = Divergent
DV = Deletion and Divergent

* Improved BAM_preprocessor.pl functionality
- Fixed bug with translocation processing and other misc. bugs
- Changed "non-library" mode to "all"
- Renamed BAM_Preprocessor.pl to BAM_preprocessor.pl
- Easier installation (just run install.sh, then use)
- Now allows user to specify lmin/lmax values directly
- Sorting of ESP files now integrated, so no longer need to 
run sorting scripts separately

* Improved, more detailed documentation and examples. See
README.txt
GASV_Quickstart_Guide.txt
MANUAL.txt
FAQ.txt
BAM_preprocessor.txt
RELEASE_NOTES.txt

* New --maxPairedEndsPerWin Option
Allows user to run GASV quickly by skipping extremely dense genomic
regions.

* New --numChrom <value> Option
Users can specify the number of chromosomes in the genome (default is
24).

NEW IN RELEASE 1.2 ====================================
*Additional Speed Increases
Further Optimizations allow GASV clustering to run even faster with
fewer memory problems

*New Simplified BAM_preprocessor interface
Compute the min and max fragment sizes (Lmin and Lmax) from BAM files
and generate GASV input files all with a single command. See
BAM_preprocessor.txt for details.

*New --maxCliqueSize Option
This new option is a compromise between using --maxClusterSize to
screen out extremely large clusters of ESPs and the default setting
of always printing out all info for all clusters of ESPs. (See OPTIONS
in MANUAL).

NEW IN RELEASE 1.1 ====================================
*Speed increase
Optimizations allow GASV clustering to now run significantly faster

*New Options in BAM Preprocessor for Finding Lmin/Lmax
Can now find Lmin/Lmax either based on percentiles or standard
deviations. Also must now specify the number of reads to use in making
the Lmin/Lmax determination.

*--maxClusterSize Option
For clustering modes, can now avoid processing excessively large
clusters.
This option can save time by simply skipping over nebulous,
hard-to-explain clusters with hundreds or thousands of ESP's. (See
OPTIONS in MANUAL)

NEW IN RELEASE 1.0 ====================================
*SAM/BAM Format Compatibility:
A conversion tool for SAM/BAM alignment files is provided.

*Memory Efficient Mode:
Ability to process larger data sets (See OPTIONS in MANUAL)

*Maximal Model:
Outputs candidate maximal breakpoint regions as described in our ISMB
publication. (See OPTIONS in MANUAL)

*Array Comparative Genomics Hybridization Data:
GASV can compute breakpoint regions from both mapped paired ends
sequences and array CGH data. This method can also be used to compute
candidate fusion genes.  (See part III in MANUAL)

* Split Read Mode:
For a given structural variant we identify candidate "split reads"
containing the breakpoint of the variant.  (See OPTIONS in MANUAL.)

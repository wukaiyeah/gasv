 # ERROR: Lmin has been increased beyond >= Lmax

    This error Lmin>=Lmax, indicates an inconsistency in the data and means that our GASV program did not run to completion. 

     Most often the "Lmin>=Lmax" error arrises when a BAM file contains data from read libraries (with reasonably different fragment lengths or read lengths) which were labeled in the BAM file as coming from the same library.


   _*How the Issue Arrises*_  
          
     - The estimates for Lmin/Lmax (the minimum/maximum length) for each read library are computed by BAMToGASV.

       - When GASV clusters discordant fragments we require the minimum fragment length (Lmin) to be at least as large as 2 times the Readlength.  So, if GASV encounters a fragment with 2*Readlength > Lmin, GASV assumes the estimates provided were wrong and attempts to correct the problem by increasing Lmin to 2*Readlength. 
      
         -  Of course, we also need Lmin < Lmax, so if GASV increases Lmin beyond Lmax execution halts.
